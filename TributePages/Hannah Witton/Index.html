            <li><b>2017</b> - Doing It: Let's Talk About Sex...</li>
            <p>
            "Sexting. Virginity. Consent. The Big O ... Let's face it, doing it can be tricksy. I don't know anyone (including myself) who has sex all figured out. So I've written a book full of honest, hilarious (and sometimes awkward) anecdotes, confessions and revelations. And because none of us have all the answers, I've invited some friends and fellow YouTubers to talk about their sexuality, too. My book is for everyone, no matter what gender you identify as or who you fancy.<br>
            We talk about doing it safely. Doing it joyfully. Doing it when you're ready. Not doing it. Basically, doing it the way you want, when you want. So. Let's do this ...".
            </p>
            <li><b>2019</b> - The Hormone Diaries: The Bloody Truth About Our Periods.</li>
            <p>"When it comes to periods, we're often expected to cope with it quietly. But our periods and our hormones affect every area of our lives - so I am done with scuttling to the toilet with a tampon up my sleeve.<br>
                It's clear that I'm not the only one aching to be more open about this. When I reached out to the online community, I received an outpouring of raw, real and hilarious stories about what we go through simply for having a uterus.<br>
                From first periods to first coils, pimples to hot-water bottles and PCOS to endometriosis, The Hormone Diaries is your essential companion on the hormone rollercoaster. Filled with Hannah's insights, fascinating research and those priceless crowdsourced stories, it's the reassuring hug we all need.<br>
                At least 50 per cent of the world has to deal with this stuff - it's time we started talking about it".</p>
